    "### Bonus exercise: Personal Financial Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise the goal is to demonstrates a practical use case where an AI Agent will be leveraged to gain actionable insights and address key analytical questions related to managing an investment portfolio. For this use case we will ask you to combine Function Calling and Code Interpreter. These tools work together to retrieve stock prices and calculate portfolio metrics, replicating real-world workflows in investment management.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Steps:**\n",
    "1. Upload Investment Data: Import a CSV file containing the user’s investment portfolio into the OpenAI Project.\n",
    "1. Fetch Real-Time Stock Prices: Use the Yahoo! Finance API via Function Calling to retrieve up-to-date closing stock data.\n",
    "1. Perform Portfolio Analysis: Leverage Code Interpreter to compute key portfolio metrics and insights.\n",
    "1. Create Data Visualations: Leverage Code Interpreter to generate portfolio visualization, and leverage Python libraries to render image.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Hints:**\n",
    "Here bellow you can find a potential yahoo Finance API function:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "import yfinance as yf\n",

    "\n",
    "    Returns:\n",
    "    - str: The closing price of the stock for the latest trading day, or an error message if data is unavailable.\n",
