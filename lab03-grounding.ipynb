    "# Grounding with Bing Search\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grounding with Bing Search** allows your Azure AI Agents to incorporate real-time public web data when generating responses. You need to create a Grounding with Bing Search resource, and then connect this resource to your Azure AI Agents. When a user sends a query, Azure AI Agents decide if Grounding with Bing Search should be leveraged or not. If so, it will leverage Bing to search over public web data and return relevant chunks. Lastly, Azure AI Agents will use returned chunks to generate a response.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can ask questions such as \"*what is the top news today*\" or \"*what is the recent update in the retail industry in the US?*\", which require real-time public data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developers and end users don't have access to raw content returned from Grounding with Bing Search. The response, however, includes citations with links to the websites used to generate the response, and a link to the Bing query used for the search. These two *References* must be retained and displayed in the exact form provided by Microsoft, as per Grounding with Bing Search's [Use and Display Requirements](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/grounding-legal#use-and-display-requirements). See the [how to display Grounding with Bing Search results](#how-to-display-grounding-with-bing-search-results) section for details.\n",
    "\n",
    ">[!IMPORTANT]\n",
    "> 1. Your usage of Grounding with Bing Search may incur costs. See the [pricing page](https://www.microsoft.com/bing/apis/grounding-pricing) for details.\n",
    "> 1. By creating and using a Grounding with Bing Search resource through code-first experience, such as Azure CLI, or deploying through deployment template, you agree to be bound by and comply with the terms available at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/grounding-legal, which may be updated from time to time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Setup:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Register the Bing Search provider using the command below on Windows Terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```console\n",
    "       az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.Bing'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new Grounding with Bing Search resource in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.BingGroundingSearch), and select the different fields in the creation form. Make sure you create this Grounding with Bing Search resource in the same resource group as your Azure AI Agent, AI Project, and other resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. After you have created a Grounding with Bing Search resource, you can find it in [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home). Navigate to the resource group you've created the resource in, search for the Grounding with Bing Search resource you have created.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ![alt text](assets/img/resource-azure-portal.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select the Grounding with Bing Search resource you have created and copy any of the API keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![alt text](assets/img/key-resource-azure-portal.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/) and select the AI Project (make sure it's in the same resource group of your Grounding with Bing Search resource). Click **management center**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![alt text](assets/img/project-settings-button.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select **+ new connection** in the settings page. \n",
    "\n",
    "    >[!NOTE]\n",
    "    > If you re-generate the API key at a later date, you need to update the connection with the new key.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![alt text](assets/img/project-connections.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select **API key** in **other resource types**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![alt text](assets/img/api-key-connection.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Enter the following information and then create a new connection to your Grounding with Bing Search resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Endpoint: **https://api.bing.microsoft.com/**\n",
    "    - Key: **<the API key you copied from Azure Portal>**\n",
    "    - Connection name: **bing_grounding** (If you change this name, you must update the .env file.)\n",
    "    - Access: you can choose either *this project only* or *shared to all projects*. Just make sure in the sample code below, the project you entered connection string for has access to this connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Deploy a GPT-4o model as defined in the image below. The version must be **2024-08-06** and the token per minute must be at **least 3 million tokens**. Please note that the deployment might take 5 minutes before is ready for use.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we have configured everything, let's create a client object, which will contain the connection string for connecting to your AI project and other resources. To make the Grounding with Bing search tool available to your agent, use a connection to initialize the tool and attach it to the agent. You can find your connection in the **connected resources** section of your project in the Azure AI Foundry portal.\n",

    "The file search tool uses the Azure AI Search and Azure Blob Storage resources you connected during agent setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uploaded files get stored in your connected Azure Blob Storage account\n",
    "* Vector stores get created using your connected Azure AI Search resource\n",
    "\n",
    "For both agent setups, Azure OpenAI handles the entire ingestion process, which includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Automatically parsing and chunking documents\n",
    "* Generating and storing embeddings\n",
    "* Utilizing both vector and keyword searches to retrieve relevant content for user queries.\n",
    "There is no difference in the code between the two setups; the only variation is in where your files and created vector stores are stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works\n",
    "The file search tool implements several retrieval best practices out of the box to help you extract the right data from your files and augment the model’s responses. The file search tool:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rewrites user queries to optimize them for search.\n",
    "* Breaks down complex user queries into multiple searches it can run in parallel.\n",
    "* Runs both keyword and semantic searches across both agent and thread vector stores.\n",
    "* Reranks search results to pick the most relevant ones before generating the final response.\n",
    "* By default, the file search tool uses the following settings:\n",
    "    * Chunk size: 800 tokens\n",
    "    * Chunk overlap: 400 tokens\n",
    "    * Embedding model: text-embedding-3-large at 256 dimensions\n",
    "    * Maximum number of chunks added to context: 20\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vector stores\n",
    "Vector store objects give the file search tool the ability to search your files. Adding a file to a vector store automatically parses, chunks, embeds, and stores the file in a vector database that's capable of both keyword and semantic search. Each vector store can hold up to 10,000 files. Vector stores can be attached to both agents and threads. Currently you can attach at most one vector store to an agent and at most one vector store to a thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, these files can be removed from a vector store by either:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Deleting the vector store file object or,\n",
    "* By deleting the underlying file object, which removes the file it from all vector_store and code_interpreter configurations across all agents and threads in your organization\n",
    "The maximum file size is 512 MB. Each file should contain no more than 5,000,000 tokens per file (computed automatically when you attach a file).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ensuring vector store readiness before creating runs\n",
    "We highly recommend that you ensure all files in a vector_store are fully processed before you create a run. This ensures that all the data in your vector store is searchable. You can check for vector store readiness by using the polling helpers in the SDKs, or by manually polling the vector store object to ensure the status is completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a fallback, there's a 60-second maximum wait in the run object when the thread's vector store contains files that are still being processed. This is to ensure that any files your users upload in a thread a fully searchable before the run proceeds. This fallback wait does not apply to the agent's vector store."
