    "## Azure AI Agent Service\n",
    "\n",
    "The Azure AI Agent Service is a fully managed platform designed to enable developers to build, deploy, and manage intelligent agents efficiently. By leveraging Azure's ecosystem, developers can focus on the logic and behaviors of their agents without worrying about infrastructure and scalability challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of Azure AI Agent Service\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agent Lifecycle Management**: Provides tools to simplify the development, deployment, and monitoring of agents across various environments.\n",
    "2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Agents respond to triggers and events, enabling real-time decision-making and interactions.\n",
    "3. **Skill Integration and Orchestration**: Enables agents to connect and orchestrate multiple external tools, APIs, and services to extend their functionality.\n",
    "4. **State Management**: Supports memory and state retention to ensure agents can maintain context and continuity during interactions.\n",
    "5. **Multi-Modal Interactions**: Allows agents to interact through multiple channels, such as chat, voice, and APIs.\n",
    "6. **Security and Compliance**: Leverages Azure’s security features to ensure secure and compliant deployment.\n",
    "7. **Interoperability**: Seamlessly integrates with Azure OpenAI, Cognitive Services, and other Azure tools to create comprehensive solutions.\n",
    "8. **Low-Code/No-Code Options**: Empowers users with varying technical expertise to design and deploy agents using intuitive interfaces and pre-built templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Azure AI Agent Service Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Within Azure AI Foundry, an AI Agent acts as a \"smart\" microservice that can be used to answer questions (RAG), perform actions, or completely automate workflows. It achieves this by combining the power of generative AI models with tools that allow it to access and interact with real-world data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Azure AI Agent Service uses the same wire protocol as Azure OpenAI Assistants, you can use either OpenAI SDKs or Azure AI Foundry SDKs to create and run an agent in just a few lines of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do a quick recap of the concepts we will need to understand to use the Azure AI Agent Service with the OpenAI SDK or the AI Foundry SDK:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Agent / Assistant**: An AI entity that uses AI models in conjunction with tools. It can be instructed and controlled to perform various tasks.\n",
    "* **Tool**:\tTools help extend an agent’s ability to reliably and accurately respond during conversation. Such as connecting to user-defined knowledge bases to ground the model, or enabling web search to provide current information.\n",
    "* **Thread**: Represents a conversation session between an AI entity (or Agent) and another agent or user. It stores messages and handles truncation to fit content into a model’s context.\t\n",
    "* **Message**:  A message created by an agent or a user. Messages can include text, images, and other files. Messages are stored as a list on the Thread.\n",
    "* **Run**: Activation of an agent to begin running based on the contents of Thread. The agent uses its configuration and Thread’s Messages to perform tasks by calling models and tools. As part of a Run, the agent appends Messages to the Thread.\n",
    "* **Run Step**: A detailed list of steps the agent took as part of a Run. An agent can call tools or create Messages during its run. Examining Run Steps allows you to understand how the agent is getting to its results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure AI Agent Service provides a more streamlined and secure way to build and deploy AI agents. This includes:\n",
    "* Automatic tool calling – no need to parse a tool call, invoke the tool, and handle the response; all of this is now done server-side\n",
    "* Securely managed data – instead of managing your own conversation state, you can rely on threads to store all the information you need\n",
    "* Out-of-the-box tools – In addition to the file retrieval and code interpreter tools provided by Azure OpenAI Assistants, Azure AI Agent Service also comes with a set of tools that you can use to interact with your data sources, such as Bing, Azure AI Search, and Azure Functions.\n"
